## CS260-Project

# Elevator Pitch
If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, you have definitely run into the issue of knowing which Pokemon you keep and which ones to transfer. With such limited and storage and there being over 1000 of these creatures it can be tough to know which ones are valuable. My project is to provide an easy way to access this information across other databases so you can have confidence that the ones you keep are the cream of the crop.
# Key Features
-Ability to see how your Pokemon ranks as an overall Attacker and by its Type
-Access to 100% IV CP for common levels such as raids, field research and eggs
-Access to PVP rankings for each League (Great, Ultra, Master)
-Perfect IVs for each League

Note: This information will be taken from other databases that already exist such as Gamepress and Stadium Go.
